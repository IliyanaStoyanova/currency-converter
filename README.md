# Currency Converter

## This is the website to generate the exchange rate.

### I use on the website:

- _Javascript_<br/>
- _HTML_<br/>
- _CSS_<br/>
- _Bootstrap_<br/>

**What's the idea?** <br/>
The website is where you can get the exchange rate. Set the amount and select the currencies.

**Website features:**

- Set amount;
- Choose from/to currency.

### Start the project
